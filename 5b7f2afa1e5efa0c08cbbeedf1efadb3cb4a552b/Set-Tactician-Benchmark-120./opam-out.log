  ∗ coq-tactician-stdlib 8.11.dev  *** WARNING ***
                                   This package will overwrite Coq's standard library files.
                                   A backup of the original files will be placed under Coq's
                                   library directory at user-contrib/tactician-stdlib-backup/
                                   and they will be restored when you remove this package.
                                   After installation of this package, all other Coq packages
                                   also need to be recompiled. Running the 'tactician recompile'
                                   command-line utility will help with this process.
